                    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Programming Language which was created by Berners-Lee. HTML first standard specification was published in 1995. It is one of the globally accepted programming languages for the development of interactive websites and webpages. Nowadays, HTML is used with other languages like Javascript, CSS which gives more look and feel to a website by providing different font color, font size, and alignment to the whole content.</p>
                    <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages so it uses simple tags to markup and format the content. HTML is one of the best option to develop the webpage or website for the small or growing business that does not want to invest more in purchasing software or its license and does not require any advanced programming for their websites. HTML is also very useful for beginners in web designing field.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <h4>Advantages of Coding HTML:</h4><br>
                <p> • HTML is free of cost and there is no need to purchase specific software</p>
                <p> • HTML is widely used and it is the default in every windows operating system</p>
                <p> • HTML is easy to Learn and Use</p>
                <p> • HTML is supported by almost all the browsers around the globe</p>
                <p> • HTML is one of the most friendly search engines in comparison to all the programming languages available in the market. HTML websites are easier to read and accessed by web crawlers and hence reduces parsing time and the page load time of the website hence improving its performance.</p>
                <p> • HTML is very easy to edit as there is no need to have a special interface or platform to edit it. It is written in simple Notepad and hence can be simply edited in any text editor like Notepad, Notepad++, etc</p>
                <p> • HTML can be easily integrated with multiple languages and does not create any issues in it. For example in Javascript, Php, node.js, CSS and many more</p>
                <p> • HTML is lightweight language. It has a high signal to noise ratio as compared to other forms of communication. It is also faster to download HTML code, which means it is highly compressive also.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Disadvantages of Coding HTML:</h4><br>

                <p> • HTML can create only static and plain pages and cannot produce dynamic output alone, since it is a static language. Instead, to add dynamically generated content to their pages, Web developers need to learn additional languages such as PHP, ASP or JavaScript. Code snippets written using those languages are then added to the original HTML file to generate the dynamic content</p>
                <p> • In HTML you need to write lot of code to make a simple webpage</p>
                <p> • In HTML security features offered are limited</p>
                <p> • The structuring of HTML documents is hard to grasp so if you need to write long code for making a webpage then it produces some complexity.</p>
                <p>• In HTML you have to keep up with deprecated tags, and make sure not to use them Deprecated tags appear because another language that works with HTML has replaced the original work of the tag; thus the other language needs to be learned</p><br>

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Advantages of Using HTML Editors:</h4><br>
                    <p> • For simple edits it is often faster to make changes to a page using a text editor</p>
                    <p> • Text editors teach you to read HTML. This is especially important if you work on a team of web developers. The HTML can be spaced as your team likes it, and include comments or other notes to allow more efficient editing by other team members</p>
                    <p> • A web developer who can write HTML using a text editor will be more marketable than one who can only use a WYSIWYG editor</p>
                    <p> • The only HTML that will be in the document will be tags that you placed there deliberately. This will help your pages download faster, as well as look leaner.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Disadvantages of Using HTML Editors:</h4><br>

                    <p> • While most HTML text editors can help with tags and suggest attributes and so on, these helpers are no substitute for knowing HTML. Most modern text editors offer drag-and-drop styles such as bold and italic, but if you can't remember the code for "non-breaking space" your editor might not be able to help.</p>
                    <p> • Because you have to learn both HTML and the editor functions itself, a beginner will find a text editor more difficult to use.</p>
                    <p> • Some people find text editors more difficult to design pages in because they can't visualize how the page will look from just the HTML.</p>
                    <p> • The importance of image ALT attribute is not explicitly pointed out by WYSIWYG editors as well as the heading tags of a web page. If these aspects are missed, it will complicate the website’s recognition by search engines</p>
                    <p> • HTML tables to layout a page are an old technique that is displaced by Cascading Style Sheets</p>
